/********************************
 * TODO: Implement this class based on https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/search
 * 
 * Gaby do you want to volunteer on this ? We can Mob Program again but you ll be the driver :)
 * 
 * Step 1: Import API key. 
 * Step 2: Go to the TextSearch Request Section and read take note of the required parameters.
 * Step 4: Read about the Query parameter. (Should we add a types parameter? probably yes)
 * Step 5: Go to the Documentation and grab the textsearch link under Place Search.
 * 
 * We are now ready to write the code
 * 
 * Step 6: Create a private variable called key, and set its value to the imported API key from step 1.
 * Step 7: Create a private variable called endpoint, and set it equal to the link found in the doc
 *         on step 5.
 * 
 * Step 8: Implement getPlacesByZipCode(zipCode)
